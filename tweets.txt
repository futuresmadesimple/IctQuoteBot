What’s your routine—daily and weekly—and how do you handle drawdown?
---
Many live above their income to put on a facade.
---
Educators push the image of wealth quickly; it’s intoxicating when you need to make ends meet.
---
Write down what your life costs each month; make a budget.
---
Don’t be a slave to image.
---
Trade soberly: target the least monthly end for a few months.

You have no idea what it feels like to grow an account from $10K to $50K to $100K until you do it.

Young folks—control the urge to chase immediate wealth.
---
Use funded accounts to seed your own retail account.
---
Lower your expenses and start preparing to think like a business owner.
---
---
You have to have rules: when should I do something, when should I expect a setup to form?
---
Don't seek the approval from others.
---
Your family is not going to understand what you're trying to do.
---
Reward yourself when you do it right, and when you do it wrong give yourself permission to be wrong.
---
Learn risk management well—and make that your initial, very first thing to master.
---
These markets are vampires—they will suck every drop and the marrow in your bones if you give it to them.
---
Manage your family time and schedule it—no markets, no charts, no Twitter.
---
Keep a study and trade schedule.
---
Be patient with your development.
---
Avoid system hopping.
---
Settle on one trade setup initially.
---
Determine your asset class—stick to that one asset class.
---
Be an independent thinking trader—not a codependent one.
---
Don’t let the market steal your life.
---
What if you stop worrying about losing and focus on how to manage the money and the risk.
---
It cannot see your particular stop; the broker can, but the delivery algorithm cannot.
---
Build good habits and remove the opportunity to fall into bad habits.
---
Be honest in back testing—poor expectations create backwards results.
---
You’ll grow your understanding as the characteristics repeat over and over again.
---
Practice every single day, keep a backlog, and study it on the weekends.
---
Manage to keep risk below three percent maximum.
---
Identify what negates your idea before you even put the trade on.
---
Take the loss, go home for the day, and see what happens tomorrow.
---
Avoid large risk for large wins.
---
Ignore unprofitable traders’ advice on risk.

Proof of concept comes before live funds.

---
Reduce risk as you get paid—manage the trader as much as the trade.

Cut exposure when you’re in drawdown; that’s your staying power.
---
You want the holy grail? This is it: risk control.
---
Above the weekly open is where smart money distributes when the higher time frame is bearish.
---
The Judas swing on a bullish week is the dip below the open that fuels the run higher.
---
Let the Sunday open frame your bias; let Tuesday/Wednesday define your entry.
---
A weekly bias isn’t a guarantee—it’s a wind at your back. You still manage risk.
---
Day trading isn’t every-day trading. Skip days without your setup.
---
Bias = daily chart. Liquidity targets = hourly chart.
---
Yesterday’s high isn’t ‘resistance’—it’s a magnet when bias is up.
---
If a day closes down in an up-bias, I’m stalking the next OTE long.
---
Momentum that starts on the daily tends to persist 2–5 days.
---
The ‘draw on liquidity’ is real: price seeks pools of stops.
---
Stop trying to be perfect; aim to be consistent.
---
Practice in demo until the outcome no longer shakes you.
---
If you need an indicator to believe it, you’ll miss the lesson: price tells you.
---
OTEs that align with kill zones are the A+ tickets.
---
Rules first, entries second; without structure you’re just gambling.
---
When I refer to power 3 what I'm referring to is the three components that make up generic price action: the accumulation phase, a manipulation stage, and then an arranged expansion and then a distribution.
---
You cannot escape it—you're going to lose money, you're going to lose on trades, and there's no reason to worry about it.
---
While you develop and practice in your demo account, it's important for you to implement strict risk controls.
---
Consider one percent per setup—that means one percent of your total account equity—and gradually working your way up to 2 percent if this meets your risk tolerance.
---
It's important not to try to swing for homeruns or take larger risk to try to grow your account faster—it's not necessary, it's reckless.
---
Over leverage will impede your development and drastically decrease your chances of seeing responsible equity growth.
---
Don't think that you have to know everything right now—because you don't.
---
The person you sit and stare at in the mirror—that person is your biggest enemy right now.
---
Open, high, low, and close is the four best indicators you're ever going to find in price action—it's price.
---
Central banks are the producer of currency prices and are the market maker.
---
Currency prices are 100% controlled and manipulated by central banks.
---
Central banks are not following retail indicators or flawed retail logic.
---
Supply and demand has no bearing on the delivery of currency prices. Period.
---
Central banks employ high-tech algorithms to deliver currency price feeds and they do not run on supply and demand.
---
SMT is simply a divergence between closely correlated assets or markets.
---
All boats rise with the tide—if euro rallies, reasonably expect pound to rally as well.
---
Experience is going to guide you on how many candles really make up a consolidation.
---
Backtesting and studying old data makes every successful trader better.
---
Smart money buys sell stops and sells to buy stops.
---
SMT: you only consider using it when a key level should be influencing price.
---
SMT is not a timing tool; it’s a confirmation tool.
---
Go into the charts looking to disprove what I’m saying—and you’re going to shock yourself.
---
Pad and pen—sit down, take notes, and study.
---
There’s no better way to learn than applying the model to a live chart and watching it unfold.
---
If we’re bullish, there’s a 70% chance the low of the week forms on Monday, Tuesday, or by Wednesday’s New York session.
---
Before directionally driven moves, opposing stops are taken and then price is allowed to deliver.
---
In a bullish week, buy at or below the opening price each day.
---
We don’t care where the week closes—only where volatility mostly sends price.
---
Study the relationship of time and price; time comes first.
---
Each day is one-fifth of the weekly range with repeating signatures.
---
If you’re bullish, watch for short-term lows to be taken and then look to buy.
---
Backtest day of week and time of day—those windows frame the highest-probability entries.
---
Time and price theory blends the calendar clock with liquidity targets.
---
Bias first; entries second.
---
Relative equal highs and lows are liquidity, not support or resistance.
---
Traders don’t push price; the algorithm does.
---
Expect distribution into buy stops above the original consolidation in a buy model.
---
Expect pullbacks to order blocks or optimal trade entry inside the kill zones.
---
After weekly objectives are met early, expect consolidation or deeper retracement.
---
Always view TradingView through the lens of New York time, wherever you live.
---
Price won’t blast from every swept low—timing matters.
---
Three entry tools matter: stop runs, order blocks, and optimal trade entry.
---
If you’re developing, stand aside on FOMC—the whipsaw will paralyze you.
---
Put your faith in time and price, not indicators.
---
Before strong directional moves, opposing stops are taken, then price is allowed to deliver.
---
London and New York kill zones frame the highest-probability entries.
---
Don’t obsess over the exact top; catch the meat of the move and move on.
---
FOMC days are “seek & destroy”—they raid both sides before expanding.
---
Smart money accumulates below daily sell-side liquidity and distributes above weekly buy-side.
---
After sweeping Thursday’s high on Friday, expect a return into the weekly range.
---
Late in the week, probability favors retracement over continuation once objectives are met.
---
Time first, then price—calendar and clock anchor the setup.
---
Trade the narrative: accumulation → manipulation → distribution to the next pool.
---
When a level is swept, ask “where is the opposing liquidity?” and aim there.
---
You can carve out income with this—riches aren’t the goal; consistency is.
---
Don’t tell friends and family about your trades; protect your mindset.
---
Don’t quit—study, practice, and let time unlock understanding.
