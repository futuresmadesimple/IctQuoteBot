Look past the image lifestyle.
---
Approach your life as a business and run your life as a business.
---
Change the state of mind from impossible to I’m possible.
---
If you don’t believe it’s possible for you, nothing you learn will help you.
---
Cast forth a vision: where are you going, what’s your objective, what’s your goal?
---
What’s your routine—daily and weekly—and how do you handle drawdown?
---
Income is your only working resource unless you add income streams.
---
Many live above their income to put on a facade.
---
Can you build wealth in trading? Absolutely—but nobody starts there.
---
Educators push the image of wealth quickly; it’s intoxicating when you need to make ends meet.
---
If you’re pretending to be somebody you’re not, stop. This is your wake-up call.
---
Write down what your life costs each month; make a budget.
---
Don’t be a slave to image.
---
You cannot allow monthly ends to plague your decision making in trading.
---
Demo is not live—it's a different world.
---
You don’t get good at big leverage by funding bigger; you condition yourself over time with little.
---
Trade soberly: target the least monthly end for a few months.
---
Only consider trading for a living when you’re properly funded—about $100,000 or more.
---
Markets can become self-medication—don’t chase the dopamine hit.
---
Pressure from the real world makes you abandon rules and over-leverage.
---
Guard your mind.
---
You have no idea what it feels like to grow an account from $10K to $50K to $100K until you do it.
---
Many treat funded challenges like a lottery.
---
Protect your access to the funded account—follow the rules.
---
If you chose this path, it needs to be second only to family.
---
This craft is a cruel lover if you don’t give it the time it demands.
---
Make ends meet first; grow from there.
---
Peace of mind and financial solitude are better than image.
---
The chart reflects your life pressures unless you control them.
---
Vision first, process next, lifestyle last.
---
Stop pretending to be somebody you’re not and do the work.
---
Ends must meet—but don’t take fear about your ends into the marketplace.
---
Protect your rules; they protect your account.
---
A structured monthly target turns randomness into progress.
---
Funded margin isn’t psychological readiness.
---
Trading is absolutely a unique solo sport.
---
Run your life like a business.
---
Employment income is static—limited to what your employer feels you’re worth.
---
You’re investing in yourself with a plan of action.
---
It may seem impossible right now, but I assure you it is possible.
---
Young folks—control the urge to chase immediate wealth.
---
Learn to read the charts and business opportunities open—bringing business income.
---
How much do I need to start trading? You answer that, but my canned response is two times your monthly income.
---
Use funded accounts to seed your own retail account.
---
Small capital to secure a funded account beats depositing $10,000 you might blow.
---
Stop worrying about the money—scared money makes no money.
---
When ends are already met, you won’t be impulsive with your retail account.
---
Think like a business owner, not a gambler.
---
Lower your expenses and start preparing to think like a business owner.
---
I’m not here to look smart—I got into this to make money and not work the rest of my life.
---
When you have income streams, confidence doesn’t translate into over-leveraged trading.
---
List out all of your monthly ends—the bills you have to make every single month—and trim what’s not essential.
---
We’re not trying to predict the reaction to the news—we wait for it to hit.
---
---
Price action models are useless to anyone that hasn't really trained, studied, and did back testing.
---
You only need to find one setup and then be done for the day.
---
Smart money concepts are not going to die out.
---
If you don't have the understanding of liquidity, your trading is going to suffer from it.
---
Most fair value gaps will not completely close on re-delivery of price.
---
You are not expected to be in every possible trade idea or price swing.
---
You have to have rules: when should I do something, when should I expect a setup to form?
---
The first six years of my trading development are plagued with everything you could have possibly done wrong.
---
Don't seek the approval from others.
---
Your family is not going to understand what you're trying to do.
---
Your friends are only going to be interested once you start making money.
---
Don't go to work and tell your co-workers that you're going to be quitting your job soon.
---
You have to pursue this on your own steam, your own energy.
---
Reward yourself when you do it right, and when you do it wrong give yourself permission to be wrong.
---
Learn risk management well—and make that your initial, very first thing to master.
---
Appreciate the percentage over the dollar gain or loss.
---
Learn to limit trade frequency.
---
Don't change strategies while you're in a trade.
---
Be content with enough.
---
These markets are vampires—they will suck every drop and the marrow in your bones if you give it to them.
---
Manage your family time and schedule it—no markets, no charts, no Twitter.
---
Keep a study and trade schedule.
---
Be patient with your development.
---
You don't have to rush—especially if you're younger than thirty.
---
Avoid looking for hot-hand gurus.
---
Be willing to lose—and lose a lot—early on. It's part of it.
---
Don't count other people's money.
---
Don't change trading approaches—stick to one method and master it.
---
Avoid system hopping.
---
Every model loses—you’re going to have to accept that.
---
Find your unique model and grow from it.
---
Settle on one trade setup initially.
---
Determine your asset class—stick to that one asset class.
---
Outline when you want to buy and when you want to go short—put it on paper.
---
Build mini study journal cases—not live trades with real money.
---
Recognition comes from study; you'll recognize it as it forms.
---
You have to seek your own approval by your own study and your own development.
---
Give yourself permission to be wrong and allow yourself to grow.
---
Losses are normal—control them; over time you’ll make more money than you lose.
---
Stick to what you were trying to do: scale out, hit your target, move to the sidelines.
---
Off days and holidays: pour that time into your family.
---
Don't measure yourself against someone else.
---
Be an independent thinking trader—not a codependent one.
---
Losses are part of the business transactions in this industry.
---
Binge-watching charts grooms you as a gambler.
---
Set realistic timelines—or you rush to destruction.
---
Don’t let the market steal your life.
---
Treat losses like normal life setbacks, not grand catastrophes.
---
What if you stop worrying about losing and focus on how to manage the money and the risk.
---
Monthly highs and lows, weekly highs and lows, daily highs and lows, and finally session highs and lows.
---
Remember this: to and through.
---
You don’t need perfection to be profitable; pursue alignment with order flow.
---
It’s not about being right—it’s about being aligned with the order flow.
---
Daily highs and lows offer the potential for draws on liquidity—buy stops above, sell stops below.
---
Trading without stops will make you lose money faster.
---
The algorithm seeks sell-side liquidity below old lows and buy-side liquidity above old highs.
---
It cannot see your particular stop; the broker can, but the delivery algorithm cannot.
---
Focus right away just trading the New York session—it’s going to be the easiest one.
---
Wait for the market to show its hand—then trade with it.
---
Build good habits and remove the opportunity to fall into bad habits.
---
Don’t have it in your mindset you have to take a lot of trades every single day.
---
Strip the chart down and focus on the four price levels: the open, the high, the low, and the close.
---
Focus on previous day’s highs and lows, previous week’s highs and lows, previous month’s highs and lows.
---
Measure entry to target time, drawdown, and how long the trade took.
---
Don’t blow your account because you can’t accept that you were wrong.
---
Use your journal for positive, constructive notes—no toxic thinking.
---
Be honest in back testing—poor expectations create backwards results.
---
You’ll grow your understanding as the characteristics repeat over and over again.
---
Practice every single day, keep a backlog, and study it on the weekends.
---
TradingView, demo platforms, and back-testing tools are for building habits—not gambling.
---
Power of Three: accumulation, manipulation, distribution—day after day.
---
Stay with one framework and build a large sample set before you touch live funds.
---
When am I ready for live funds? It begins with proof of concept.
---
Manage to keep risk below three percent maximum.
---
Formulate everything you’re doing to get in sync with the monthly bias.
---
Align seasonal tendency, quarterly shift, and monthly bias with a weekly profile.
---
You’re not trying to go against momentum—you’re trying to get in sync with institutional order flow.
---
London open often sets the high or low; New York continues—unless a key level forces reversal.
---
Time of day, in concert with bias, puts you in the highest order of probability.
---
Don’t rush profits; keep the monthly return as the focus.
---
Invite the possibility of being wrong—perfection will always evade you.
---
Preserve capital first; preserve mental capital always.
---
Identify what negates your idea before you even put the trade on.
---
Avoid chasing parabolic equity surges.
---
Reduce leverage when taking losses.
---
Take the loss, go home for the day, and see what happens tomorrow.
---
Avoid large risk for large wins.
---
Consider the negatives of forcing setups; impatience invites failure.
---
Taking partials reduces risk while paying you.
---
Ignore unprofitable traders’ advice on risk.
---
Weather series of consecutive losses; every trader suffers drawdown.
---
Multiple losses do not prove your method is broken.
---
Stick to the method and reduce risk after losses.
---
Six years in—you finally grow into yourself as a trader.
---
Before year six you’re a wild cowboy; after, you know exactly what you’re looking for.
---
One trade should never be able to wipe out the account.
---
Don’t measure yourself against others—that stunts your growth.
---
Your wins are your wins; your losses are your losses—own them.
---
Proof of concept comes before live funds.
---
Build plateaus in equity by scaling down after losses, then scaling back up.
---
Trust yourself; don’t outsource risk decisions to strangers.
---
You will lose fortunes—expect the pain; it won’t kill you.
---
Perfection isn’t required; discipline is.
---
Learn to locate high-probability liquidity pools.
---
Order blocks can offer high-accuracy, low-drawdown entries.
---
Scale profits—and learn how to make money even when you’re wrong.
---
Think completely opposite of retail.
---
Price is fractal—the same formations repeat on every timeframe.
---
If you can’t succeed on demo, you won’t succeed live.
---
Play in the sandbox—build good habits on a demo account.
---
Ask: where would everyone else’s trade idea fail?
---
Equal highs and equal lows are the easiest liquidity to spot.
---
Above equal highs sit buy stops; below equal lows sit sell stops.
---
Institutions hunt counterparties—orders resting above highs and below lows.
---
We’re not gambling—we’re hunting high-probability scenarios.
---
Price moves to where orders reside—above old highs and below old lows.
---
OTE: the classic 62%–70.5% retracement is a powerful framework.
---
After a liquidity sweep, price often reverses—plan for that.
---
Zero heat entries come from planning, not luck.
---
Take partials—you never know if the market will reach your objective.
---
Reduce risk as you get paid—manage the trader as much as the trade.
---
Context + liquidity + timing = a predictable scalp.
---
An eight-loss streak is absolutely realistic; be prepared for it.
---
We start arm-wrestling the market because we want to be right—that’s how accounts die.
---
You’re not only trading with money—you’re trading with mental capital.
---
5% risk is absolutely too much—it’s insane. Don’t do it.
---
No one will control your risk for you—not your spouse, not your broker. It must be in your plan.
---
I hate losing—but I reduce risk after a loss instead of swinging harder.
---
There is no perfect trader and no perfect system—losses are part of this business.
---
Over-leveraging because ‘it doesn’t hurt enough yet’ will wreck you.
---
Adding more money after a bad week isn’t the answer—discipline is.
---
Cut exposure when you’re in drawdown; that’s your staying power.
---
Whatever you offer the market with open palms, it will take.
---
Controlling risk is more important than the entry signal or the exit.
---
You want the holy grail? This is it: risk control.
---
Stick to the game plan: control risk, survive, and longevity follows.
---
Control risk first; profits come later.
---
Decide who you are—position trader, swing trader, short-term, day trader, or scalper—before you decide what to do.
---
For beginners, short-term or day trading gives the most useful feedback; skip scalping at first.
---
Use three timeframes per style: position (monthly/weekly/daily), swing (daily/4h/1h), short-term (4h/1h/15m), day (1h/15m/5m).
---
The highest-probability trades align with the higher-timeframe direction.
---
Trend, reversal, or consolidation—your market profile frames every decision.
---
Price never moves in a straight line; it swings, consolidates, and swings again.
---
Between entry and target lies the gray area—get comfortable living there.
---
Project targets with measured swings and legs—and exit before the exact objective.
---
You can’t force price to do what you want—you can only align with it.
---
Use time and price together: act when your level and the kill zone line up.
---
Wait for most, not all, of your tools to align, then act.
---
Let the highest timeframe show where price is reaching; time entries with the mid and low frames.
---
Measured moves matter: replicate prior swings to anticipate distance.
---
Your lowest timeframe is for entries; your mid timeframe is for management; your highest builds the premise.
---
When structure shifts, expect retracements—use them for new entries.
---
Keep your trading controlled to keep your emotions controlled.
---
Profitability beats being ‘right’ every time.
---
Weekly bias 101: in bullish conditions, the low of the week usually forms between Sunday’s open and Wednesday’s New York open.
---
Plot the Sunday opening price across the whole week—then let the market tell you overbought/oversold without indicators.
---
Weekly ‘power of three’: accumulate below the open, manipulate around it, distribute away from it.
---
Trading above the weekly open in a bearish week = overbought. Trading below the open in a bullish week = oversold.
---
Below the weekly open is where smart money accumulates when the higher time frame is bullish.
---
Above the weekly open is where smart money distributes when the higher time frame is bearish.
---
The Judas swing on a bullish week is the dip below the open that fuels the run higher.
---
Wednesday is the line in the sand: once price breaks the weekly open, it should expand away from it.
---
Partial profits aren’t weakness—they pay the trader and de-risk the position.
---
Let the Sunday open frame your bias; let Tuesday/Wednesday define your entry.
---
A weekly bias isn’t a guarantee—it’s a wind at your back. You still manage risk.
---
Pre-plan your exit before the expansion begins; don’t negotiate with a fast market after it’s moving.
